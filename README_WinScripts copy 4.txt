
Note: do *NOT* use this directory as "default working directory" to execute the scripts!

Instead of that, create and/or set an own working directory somewhere else and call the scripts from there.
===========================================================================================================

- MakeKit.bat   create prxsniff.jar and other files used by the installation kit

- ProxySnifferConsole.bat   run the console directly from compiled source (w/o the need of prxsniff.jar)

Alternatively, instead of executing ProxySnifferConsole.bat, you can run the product as 4 independent processes by calling:
- ProxySniffer.bat
- WebAdmin.bat
- ExecAgent.bat
- JobController.bat

Hint: you have to put the file prxsniff.key (containing a valid GUI license key) into your working directory in order to run the product successful.
